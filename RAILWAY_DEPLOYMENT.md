# Railway Backend Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Deploy Ownexa Backend to Railway

### Prerequisites
1. Create a Railway account at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Install Railway CLI: `npm install -g @railway/cli`
3. Login to Railway: `railway login`

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project
Your project is already configured with:
- âœ… `app.py` - Main Flask application
- âœ… `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- âœ… `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- âœ… Neon database connection

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

#### Option A: Using Railway CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize Railway project
railway init

# Set environment variables
railway variables set NEON_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_V8OySJF5njdT@ep-summer-sky-adwixnct-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require"
railway variables set SECRET_KEY="ownexa-production-secret-key-2024"
railway variables set FLASK_ENV="production"

# Deploy
railway up
```

#### Option B: Using Railway Web Interface
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign in
2. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Railway will automatically detect Python and deploy
5. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   - `NEON_DATABASE_URL`: Your Neon connection string
   - `SECRET_KEY`: A secure random string
   - `FLASK_ENV`: production

### Step 3: Get Your Railway URL
After deployment, Railway will provide you with a URL like:
```
https://ownexa-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

### Step 4: Update Frontend Configuration
Update your frontend to point to the new Railway backend:

1. Update `frontend/vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL": "https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app"
  }
}
```

2. Update `frontend/src/config.js`:
```javascript
API_BASE_URL: process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL || 'https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app'
```

3. Redeploy frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

### Step 5: Test the Deployment

#### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health
```

#### Test Registration
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "TestPass123!",
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "User",
    "role": "OWNER",
    "street_address_1": "123 Test St",
    "city": "Test City",
    "state": "TX",
    "zip_code": "12345"
  }'
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Railway Advantages

âœ… **Flask-Friendly**: Perfect for Python/Flask applications  
âœ… **Free Tier**: 512MB RAM, 1GB disk (sufficient for development)  
âœ… **Auto-Scaling**: Scales automatically based on traffic  
âœ… **PostgreSQL Support**: Native PostgreSQL support  
âœ… **Environment Variables**: Easy configuration management  
âœ… **Logs**: Real-time logging and monitoring  

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Verify NEON_DATABASE_URL is correct
   - Ensure database allows connections from Railway IPs

2. **Module Import Errors**
   - Check requirements.txt has all dependencies
   - Railway uses Python 3.11 by default

3. **CORS Issues**
   - CORS is already configured in the Flask app
   - Make sure frontend URL is allowed

### Useful Railway Commands:
```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# View environment variables
railway variables

# Restart deployment
railway restart

# View project status
railway status
```

## ðŸ“Š Cost Comparison

| Platform | Free Tier | Paid Plans | Flask Support |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Vercel | Limited | $20+/month | Poor |
| Railway | 512MB RAM | $5+/month | Excellent |
| Render | 750h/month | $7+/month | Good |
| Heroku | None | $7+/month | Good |

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

Once deployed, you'll have:
- âœ… Full Flask API with database connectivity
- âœ… All endpoints working (auth, properties, tenants, etc.)
- âœ… CSV import functionality
- âœ… File upload support
- âœ… Production-ready backend

Your Railway URL will be: `https://your-project-name.up.railway.app`
